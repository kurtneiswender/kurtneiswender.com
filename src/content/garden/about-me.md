## Who am I?

Hello, my name is Kurt Neiswender. I am a registered architect, LEED Accredited Professional, and Assistant Professor of Practice at [Lawrence Technological University](https://ltu.edu/faculty/neiswender-aia-kurt/) in the College of Architecture and Design. I'm also the founder and principal architect at [Urban Colab Architecture, L3C](https://www.urbancolab.design) in Flint, Michigan.

## Where am I From?

I was born in Stamford, Connecticut and was raised there until I went off to college when I was eighteen.

## Schooling

I attended the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California. This experience was where my interest in architecture grew into a passion and this passion was fueled by the work of [deconstructivist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstructivism) avant-garde architects like [Morphosis](https://www.morphosis.com/), [Eric Owen Moss](http://ericowenmoss.com/), and others. I also studied at [Columbia University's](https://www.arch.columbia.edu/) Graduate School of Architecture in the NY/Paris Program, and later earned a Master of Urban Design with Distinction from Lawrence Technological University.

After receiving my degree from USC I worked in various firms around Los Angeles — Togawa & Smith, Gruen Associates, and OJMR Architects — before moving to Michigan where I worked at MainStreet Design Build and Sedgewick + Ferweda Architects (where I helped design Michigan's first PHIUS Certified Passive House).

## What I Do Now

I lead [Urban Colab Architecture](https://www.urbancolab.design), a community-driven practice focused on sustainable housing, adaptive reuse, and equitable development in Flint. Projects include Gray Street Apartments, Orchard Grove and Manor, Crossover Outreach, and the Avalon Village Community Kitchen.

I also co-host the [Coffee Sketch Podcast](https://www.coffeesketchpodcast.com) with my good friend Jamie Crawley, AIA — 190+ episodes, listeners in 80+ countries. You can find it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@coffeesketchpodcast) too.

At LTU I teach building systems courses (HVAC, Acoustics, Illumination) and the Comprehensive Design Studio, where we're currently participating in ACSA's "Timber in the City 6" competition.
