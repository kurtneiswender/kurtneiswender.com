This resource will help you to become indispensable and build your own confidence to take an active role in your own career growth. My hope is that you won't have to go through any awkward transitions from school to work, and that you can avoid some of the embarrassing moments I had.

I look forward to engaging with you and sharing what I know to help grow the next generation of architects!
