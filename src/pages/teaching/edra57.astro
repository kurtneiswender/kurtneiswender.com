        This workshop explores how architects can use generative AI not as a
        replacement for design thinking, but as a material for building
        custom computational tools. Rather than accepting off-the-shelf
        software, we prototype instruments tailored to specific design problems.
      </p>

      <h2>Workshop Format</h2>

      <p>
        Participants work through a series of hands-on exercises that
        demonstrate the workflow from problem identification to working
        prototype. The emphasis is on <strong>agency</strong>&mdash;giving
        architects the ability to shape their own computational environment.
      </p>

      <h2>Key Themes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>Generative AI as construction material, not magic</li>
        <li>Rapid prototyping of discipline-specific tools</li>
        <li>The architect as toolmaker (historical and contemporary)</li>
        <li>Ethical considerations in AI-augmented practice</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Outcomes</h2>

      <p>
        Several tools on this site&mdash;including the
        <a href="/tools/hvac-calculator">HVAC Calculator</a> and
        <a href="/tools/echotrace">EchoTrace</a>&mdash;originated as
        demonstrations for this workshop, illustrating how targeted tools can
        emerge from practice-specific needs.
