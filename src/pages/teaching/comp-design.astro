        The Comprehensive Design Studio is a capstone course that challenges
        students to synthesize all dimensions of architectural
        practice&mdash;structural systems, environmental performance, building
        envelope, life safety, and accessibility&mdash;into a single, coherent
        design proposition.

      <h2>ACSA &ldquo;Timber in the City 6&rdquo;</h2>

      <p>
        Recent studio sections have engaged the ACSA competition brief
        &ldquo;Timber in the City,&rdquo; exploring how mass timber
        construction can address urban density, sustainability, and
        architectural expression simultaneously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Students develop fluency with CLT and glulam structural systems,
        Passive House design principles, and integrated energy modeling
        using tools developed in parallel (see the
        <a href="/tools">Tools</a> section).
      </p>

      <h2>Pedagogy</h2>

      <p>
        The studio emphasizes <strong>integration over specialization</strong>.
        Rather than treating building systems as constraints, students learn to
        see them as design opportunities. A well-resolved wall section is as
        much a design artifact as a plan diagram.
