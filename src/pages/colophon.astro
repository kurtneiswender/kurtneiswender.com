    <div class="prose animate-fade-up" style="animation-delay: 0.1s;">
      <p>
        This site is built with <strong>Astro</strong>&mdash;a static-first
        framework that ships zero JavaScript by default. The content is mostly
        prose, so a framework optimized for static pages made more sense than a
        full React application.
      </p>

      <h2>Stack</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Framework:</strong> Astro 5.x</li>
        <li><strong>Styling:</strong> Tailwind CSS 4.x</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive tools:</strong> React 18 (as separate SPAs via Vercel rewrites)</li>
        <li><strong>Content:</strong> Astro Content Collections (Markdown)</li>
        <li><strong>Hosting:</strong> Vercel</li>
        <li><strong>Domain:</strong> kurtneiswender.com</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Typography</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Headings:</strong> DM Serif Display &mdash; architectural character with sharp serifs</li>
        <li><strong>Body:</strong> Inter &mdash; clean readability for long-form prose</li>
        <li><strong>Code:</strong> JetBrains Mono &mdash; for inline code and labels</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Design Principles</h2>

      <p>
        The design follows the same principles I apply to buildings: restraint,
        proportion, and material honesty. No gradients, no visual noise, no
        decoration without purpose. The warm white background references good
        paper. The green accent evokes sustainable practice. The timber tone
        connects to the mass timber work in the teaching and tools sections.
      </p>

      <h2>Tools Integration</h2>

      <p>
        The three interactive tools (HVAC Calculator, EchoTrace, Timber
        Designer) are standalone React applications deployed to their own Vercel
        projects. They're served under <code>/tools/*</code> via Vercel path
        rewrites, so they appear seamlessly within the site while maintaining
        independent deployment cycles.
      </p>

      <h2>Garden</h2>

      <p>
        The digital garden content migrated from GitBook. Articles use a
        maturity model&mdash;seed, sprout, evergreen&mdash;to signal how
        developed each piece of thinking is. This is inspired by the digital
        garden movement and Maggie Appleton&rsquo;s writing on the pattern.
